**Introduction:**

The Bank Management System is a simple C++ console application that simulates basic banking operations. The system allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check account details, modify account information, and delete accounts. The system is designed to manage up to five bank accounts, with each account storing details such as account number, account holder's name, address, account type, and balance.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to provide a simple, user-friendly interface to perform basic banking functions such as:

1. Creating a new account.
2. Depositing money into an account.
3. Withdrawing money from an account.
4. Checking account details.
5. Modifying account information.
6. Deleting an account.

**Scope:**
This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the use of C++ structures, functions, control statements, and basic input/output operations. It is a small-scale project that can be extended with additional features such as data persistence, more account slots, and enhanced security.
